## Functional Requirements


### Requirement 1.0: Generate correct activity data.

#### Scenario

As a user hanging out with two friends, I want to find a social activity that involves 3 participants, and has a low price.

#### Dependencies

Activity data is available and accessible.

#### Assumptions

The activity returned is readable.

The activity returned is a group activity.

#### Examples

1.1

**Given** A feed of activity data is available.

**When**  The user specifies the _participants_ field to be 3 instead of the default 1.

**Then** The generator should return a random activity that is applicable for three persons.

1.2

**Given** A feed of activity data is available.

**When** The user specifies the _type_ field to be "social."

**Then** The generator should return a random activity of type "social."

1.3

**Given** A feed of activity data is available.

**When** The user specifies the _price_ field to be "low."

**Then** The generator should return a random activity that has a price of "low."

1.4

**Given** The user wants to change their mind and wants to clear the activity filters.

**When** The user clicks the "Clear filters" button.

**Then** A popup tells user the filters have been cleared successfully. The fields are cleared back to defaults and if there was a generated activity displayed it is not anymore.


### Requirement 2.0: Save activity to correct list(s).

#### Scenario

As a bored user, I want to save an activity that was generated, so that I can find it again.

#### Dependencies

Correct activity data is available and accessible.

The user is logged into an account - _firebase auth_.

#### Assumptions

The activity saved is the correct activity.

The correct list contains the desired activity.

The user can access the list after exiting the app and opening it again.

#### Examples

2.1  

**Given** The user's generated activity is "go to a local thrift shop" and user wants to save that activity to their "To-Do List."

**When**  The user clicks the "Add to To-Do List" button.

**Then** A popup tells user that that the save is successful. User can then navigate to their account and see the "go to a local thrift shop" activity included in their "To-Do List."

2.2

**Given** The user's generated activity is "volunteer at a local animal shelter" and user wants to save that activity for later.

**When** The user clicks the button to save it to their "Saved for Later List."

**Then** A popup tells user that the save is successful. User can then navigate to their account and see the "volunteer at a local animal shelter" activity included in their "Saved for Later List."

2.3

**Given** The user resets their Android device (closing the IdeaStorm app); The user wants to open the app and see the activity "learn and play a new card game" remained in their "To-Do List."

**When** The user opens the app again and navigates to the _account_ tab.

**Then** The "To-Do List" remained the same with the activity "learn and play a new card game" saved and included.

2.4

**Given** The user has the activity "write a short story" included in their "Saved for Later List."

**When** The user clicks the "Add to To-Do List" button.

**Then** The activity "write a short story" is not just removed from the "Saved for Later List", but also added to the "To-Do List" now.
